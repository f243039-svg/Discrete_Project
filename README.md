🎓 FAST University Course Management Framework🚀 OverviewThis project implements a high-level computational framework to model and manage the complex operational dependencies and rules of FAST University using Discrete Structures. The framework enforces rules related to course prerequisites, student enrollment, scheduling, and faculty assignments by leveraging core concepts such as Induction, Logic, Sets, Relations, and Functions.🏗️ Project Structure & ModulesThe framework is built around distinct modules, each addressing a specific university operation through discrete mathematics principles.Core Conceptual ModulesModuleCore FunctionalityDiscrete Concepts Used1. Induction & Strong InductionVerify multi-term course prerequisite chains (e.g., ensuring all indirect prerequisites are satisfied).Mathematical Induction, Strong Induction2. Logic & Inference EngineParse rules (e.g., faculty-course policies) and perform inference to detect conflicts or enforce policy validity.Propositional Logic, Predicate Logic, Inference Rules3. Relations ModuleDefine and check properties (reflexive, transitive, partial orders) of student-course, faculty-course, and course-room relations.Binary Relations, Equivalence Relations, Partial Orders, Relation Composition4. Functions ModuleModel assignments (e.g., courses $\to$ faculty); test for properties like injectivity, surjectivity, and bijectivity.Functions, Mappings, Composition, InverseApplication & Utility ModulesModuleCore FunctionalityDiscrete Concepts Used5. Course & SchedulingGenerate all valid course sequences for a semester using prerequisite rules efficiently.Recursive Algorithms, Dynamic Programming (DP)6. Set Operations ModuleRepresent and analyze students, courses, and faculty as sets; compute union, intersection, difference, and power sets.Set Theory, Set Operations7. Student Group CombinationAssign students to project groups, labs, and electives using combinatorial counting.Combinatorics, Counting Principles, Subsets8. Consistency CheckerDetect conflicts or violations across all modules (e.g., course overlaps, missing prerequisites, student overload).Set Intersections, Logic Inference9. Automated Proof & VerificationGenerate step-by-step formal proofs for prerequisites and logic rules.Proof Techniques, Formal Logic10. Algorithmic EfficiencyOptimize discrete operations for large datasets using memoization, recursion, and bitsets.Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Bit Manipulation💡 Conceptual Dry Runs1. Prerequisite Verification (Strong Induction)Rule: To take Advanced CS ($C_n$), a student must complete its immediate prerequisites ($C_{n-1}$), and by extension, all predecessors in the chain ($C_1, \dots, C_{n-2}$).Concept: The module uses strong induction to verify the validity of the entire prerequisite sequence $P(k)$ where $P(k)$ is the statement: "A student can enroll in the $k^{th}$ course if and only if courses $1, 2, \dots, k-1$ are completed." This requires the base case and the strong inductive step: $\big(\forall j \le k, P(j)\big) \to P(k+1)$.2. Enrollment Conflict Detection (Set Intersection)Task: Find all students who are simultaneously enrolled in both CS101 (Set $A$) and Math101 (Set $B$).Operation: The module calculates the set intersection:$$A \cap B = \{ x \mid x \in A \land x \in B \}$$Any non-empty result indicates students with potential scheduling conflicts (if the courses are offered at the same time).3. Faculty Assignment Check (Injective Function)Policy: Every course must be assigned to exactly one faculty member.Modeling: This is a function $f: \text{Courses} \to \text{Faculty}$. The function is guaranteed to be injective (one-to-one) if no two distinct courses are assigned to the same faculty. The module checks this mapping property:$$\forall c_1, c_2 \in \text{Courses}, f(c_1) = f(c_2) \implies c_1 = c_2$$🛠️ Installation and SetupPrerequisitesPython 3.x(Any specific libraries, e.g., numpy for efficiency)SetupBash# Clone the repository
